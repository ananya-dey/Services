				All limited companies have a duty to keep accounting records and prepare annual accounts. The Companies Act and other regulations specify the format in which the annual accounts must be prepared, the information that needs to be disclosed, and rules affecting the valuation, treatment of transactions, and balances appearing in the accounts.
